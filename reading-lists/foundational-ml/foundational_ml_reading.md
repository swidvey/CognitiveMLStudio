# 📘 Foundational Readings in Machine Learning

A curated list of classic and influential papers, books, and educational resources that shaped modern machine learning. This list is meant to serve as a **starting point for learners** and a **reference for deeper study**. It’s not exhaustive — just the most impactful works that I’ve personally learned from (yes, I actually have all these books on my shelf 📚).

## 📚 Recommended Books

- *An Introduction to Statistical Learning* — Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jonathan Taylor  
- *The Elements of Statistical Learning* — Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jerome Friedman  
- *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning* — Christopher M. Bishop  
- *Deep Learning* — Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville  
- *Introduction to Data Mining* — Pang-Ning Tan, Michael Steinbach, Vipin Kumar  
- *Mathematics for Machine Learning* — Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal, Cheng Soon Ong  
- *Introduction to Algorithms* — Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein  


📌 **Bonus**:  
If you’re just starting out in ML, I *highly recommend* beginning with *An Introduction to Statistical Learning*. I first read it when it was R-based, and the new Python edition is even more accessible and detailed. It’s the book I wish every ML learner had in their hands at the start.

# 📘 Foundational Readings in Neuroscience

Here is a curated list of classic and influential papers, books, and educational resources that shaped Neuroscience. This list is meant to serve as a **starting point for learners** and a **reference for deeper study**. As always, it’s not an exhaustive list, but rather a collection of work I believe is impactful, works that I’ve personally learned from. All these books on my shelf.
